# safety
The --no-sound-null-safety option is not documented in the article, however, I have not experienced any problems with it for the last few months (and especially not since the whole Flutter framework has been migrated to null safety).
`flutter run --no-sound-null-safety`
`flutter build ios --debug --config-only --no-sound-null-safety`
